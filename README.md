This repository presents a complete machine learning pipeline for **customer churn prediction** using an **XGBoost classifier**. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and deployment via a Flask API.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Develop a predictive model to **identify customers likely to churn**, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies.
- Build and deploy a **robust, scalable, and production-ready API** for real-time inference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Development

### üîÑ Preprocessing

- Removal of irrelevant features (`CustomerId`, `Surname`)  
- Encoding categorical variables (`Geography`, `Gender`)  
- Outlier detection and treatment  
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
- Class imbalance handled with **SMOTE**  

### üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Gender**: Female customers show higher churn (25.1%) than males (16.5%)  
- **Credit Card**: Churn rate nearly identical regardless of credit card ownership  
- **Activity**: Inactive members have significantly higher churn (26.9%) compared to active ones (14.3%)  
- **Geography**: Customers from Germany churn the most (32%), nearly double the rate of those from France and Spain (~16%)  

### üß™ Model Training & Evaluation

Seven classification algorithms were evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- **XGBoost** ‚Äî selected as the final model based on superior performance

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Accuracy: **0.849**
- ROC AUC: **0.857**
- Cross-validated ROC AUC: **0.961 ¬± 0.003**
- Additional metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  
- **Optimal threshold** tuning (F1-maximizing threshold: **0.38**) to balance precision and recall

## üöÄ Deployment

The trained model is deployed using **Flask**, allowing real-time predictions through a **RESTful API**. The API accepts customer data in JSON format and returns churn probability and prediction based on the optimized threshold.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. **Start the Flask API** 

   <pre> ```bash python app.py ``` </pre>
  
3. **Make predictions**

    Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/predict with customer data in JSON format.

  **Example using cURL**:
  <pre> ```bash
 curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "CreditScore": 600,
        "Age": 40,
        "Tenure": 5,
        "Balance": 50000,
        "NumOfProducts": 2,
        "EstimatedSalary": 100000,
        "Geography": "France",
        "Gender": "Male",
        "HasCrCard": 1,
        "IsActiveMember": 1
      }'
  </pre>
  
  Sample API Response:
<pre> ```bash
  {
  "churn_probability": 0.08523,
  "churn_prediction": 0,
  "threshold_used": 0.37769
  }
</pre>
